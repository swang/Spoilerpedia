Spoilerpedia
===============

This extension is based off a joke comedian Aziz Ansari performed on his Dangerously Delicious standup special. If you haven't bought it yet (for $5), goto azizansari.com and watch it.

The joke starts around 15:54 in the special. He discusses how he's never watched any of the Saw movies before but his friend recommended that he watched it because the twist at the end is crazy. Aziz searches for "saw ending" on YouTube, reads the plot summary of Saw on Wikipedia, then loads up the video and watches the ending.

So this extension automatically does that for you whenever you're on a Film page on Wikipedia! It adds spoiler bars to the last paragraph of the Plot, then loads up the 3 most relevant videos for the search, "[Film] ending" or if there is a disambiguation, "[Film] [Year] ending"

This is meant more as a joke and for me to learn about making Chrome extensions. I was originally going to make a website based off RealLifeDickParty.com unfortunately the domain is taken :(

Thanks to Franklin Henderson (@fhwrdh) for the name suggestion, Spoilerpedia, which was way better than my original name.
